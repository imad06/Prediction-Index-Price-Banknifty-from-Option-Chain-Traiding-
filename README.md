# Prediction-Index-Price-Banknifty-from-Option-Chain-Traiding-
This work represent use deep learning model LSTM to predict the index price Banknifty (Option chain) for trading Data is from website https://www.nseindia.com/option-chain for 4 days (12th Dec 2022 to 14th Dec 2022) for forecasting Banknifty Price Index for 15th Dec 2022

To predicti the index price we should define a value of LTP CALLS an LTP PUTS when LTP CALLS go move up so the index price Banknifty move up to then LTP PUTS move down and vice versa for evry 5 minutes from 09AM to 03:30PM.

To do this we should fit our data for 4 days by time series model LSTM.
